So I have been using Discord for the best majority of the last 5 years pretty much on a regular day-to-day basis.
I mainly use it to talk to my friends and that's pretty much it...
One day we were on a call and we had all kinds of connectivity issues and all that good stuff, we were already pretty much fed up with the service for many other reasons and we started to think of alternatives.
That's when I realized that I need to setup my own communications server.
